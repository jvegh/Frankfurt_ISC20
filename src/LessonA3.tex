%\subsubsection{The performance of parallelization 45+5'}
%The third lesson introduces some examples to demonstrate 
%what is wrong with parallelization in the SPA approach
%(i.e. when segregated processors attempt to distribute a task),
%particularly in the many-core approach.
%The lesson introduces different examples of the idea of
%parallelizing sequentially working computing systems and demonstrates the effective use of the parameter "effective parallelization" on examples
%taken from ancient times of computing (HW parallelization), compiler load balancing (SW parallelization) and using clouds (networked parallelization).
